We study the translational control of gene expression in order to
learn how cells change the translation of specific genes and better
understand the role of this regulation in the cell. Our research makes
extensive use of genome-scale approaches and deep sequencing.

The translation of mRNA into protein is a central step in gene
expression. Recent studies suggest that translation affects protein
levels as much as transcription. Translational control acts in diverse
processes from cellular stress responses to synaptic plasticity.
However, there are many gaps in our knowledge of translational
regulation. We cannot predict the expression level of an mRNA from its
sequence. We do not have a general framework for understanding how
RNA-binding proteins affect translation.

The first step in studying translational control is simply measuring
it more accurately.  I developed a ribosome profiling technique that
allows precise and quantitative analysis of genome-wide
in vivo translation. Ribosome profiling measures expression at the level of
translation, opening new windows on in vivo translation. It also
reports on the exact position of translating ribosomes. This allows us
to annotate the actual protein-coding sequences in complicated genomes
and transcriptomes.

Ribosome profiling also revealed extensive translation upstream of
many genes.  This unexpected translation points to the regulated use
of alternate sites of initiation, including substantial initiation at
non-AUG codons.  We believe that start codon selection is an
underappreciated point of control in gene expression.  The use of
alternate sites of initiation can produce functionally distinct
protein isoforms as well as affect the amount of protein synthesized.
This poses several questions that we want to address. We want to
understand how the potential start sites in an mRNA affect its
translation. We want to know how changes in the proteins involed in
initiation interact with these different sites. Finally, we want to
know the impact of this phenomenon--when does the cell change start
codon usage, and what are the effects?
