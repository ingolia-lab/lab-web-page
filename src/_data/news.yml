  title: Collaborative study of RPL26 UFMylation is published in <a href="https://www.pnas.org/content/116/4/1299.short"><i>Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U. S. A.</i></a>
  content: We were excited to work with <a href="https://www.kopitolab.com/home">Ron Kopito's lab</a> to learn more about how and why the ubiquitin-like modifier UFM1 is conjugated to RPL26 on ER-associated ribosomes.

  title: Our paper describing the structure of the eIF4A1•RocA•RNA complex is online at <a href="https://www.cell.com/molecular-cell/fulltext/S1097-2765(18)30996-1"><i>Molecular Cell</i></a>
  content: Shintaro began this work in the Ingolia lab and finished it in <a href="http://iwasakirna.com">his own lab at RIKEN</a> in collabration with his colleague there, <a href="http://www.riken.jp/en/research/labs/bdr/transl_struct_biol/">Takuhiro Ito</a>. It's exciting to see how RocA produces sequence-specific translational inhibition through direct drug-RNA contacts.
