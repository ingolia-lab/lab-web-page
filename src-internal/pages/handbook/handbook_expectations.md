## Talking Online

### Slack

We use the Slack as the primary means to communicate within the
lab. Full-time lab members should install the Slack app on their
computers and/or phones, and other lab affiliates should check slack
regularly. While it's important to pay attention to personal messages
and relevant channels on Slack, there's no expectation for constant
availability; you don't need to check Slack during evenings, weekends,
or vacations. Likewise, while Slack is a great way to reach Nick as
well as your other colleagues in the lab, you shouldn't rely on it as
the only way to reach someone in an emergency.

We're currently using a free Slack workspace and so we don't have
access to older message, although these messages are still saved
indefinitely by Slack.

### Email

We have a lab email list (berkeley@ingolia-lab.org) for lab-wide
announcements. Also, you'll receive important communication from the
University by email, including announcements about valuable
opportunities and administrative information requiring your
attention. You're responsible for reading your Berkeley email and
responding to it as needed.

### Calendar

We have a shared Google Calendar that we update with lab meetings,
seminars of interest, and lab-related social events. Anyone in the lab
should be able to add events to the calendar. The shared calendar is
meant to help keep track of our schedule, but it isn't used to
announce an event. Use Slack or email to let people know about
something, and then add it to the calendar as a reminder.

Nick also uses the calendar to let people know when he's traveling.

We have other shared calendars that we use to keep track of specific
equipment as well.
