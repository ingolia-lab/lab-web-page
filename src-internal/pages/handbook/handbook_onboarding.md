## Physical access to the lab

The Barker building manager, Greg Vitan, arranges card-key access to
the building and to the lab.

* For after-hours building access, you'll get a form from Greg. He can
  add your card to the database based on numbers you read from the
  card.

* For access to the lab door, you'll need to meet Greg in person and
  he'll program your card into the lab door card reader.
