## Resources

### Physical access

Barker Hall is open during business hours, and the lab is typically
left open when it's occupied. After-hours building access is
availabile by proximity card readers that work with Cal ID
cards. Contact Greg Vitan (vitan@berkeley.edu), the Barker hall
building manager, to arrange card-key access to Barker Hall. Greg can
provide a form that Nick will sign, and he can then add your Cal ID to
the Barker access list using the number on the back.

Lab access is also controlled by a proximity card reader on one of the
lab doors. Ask Nick to email Greg in order to confirm that you should
get access. Greg will need to visit the lab door card reader with you
(and your card) in person in order to add you to the access list. It's
usually easiest to find Greg in his 2nd-floor office in the morning or
early afternoon.

Many other rooms in Barker, including conference rooms and shared
equipment rooms, are managed by numeric access codes. We have
collected a table of these codes in a shared Google Sheet.

### Shared Google Drive

We currently maintain a shared Google Drive where we store a variety
of shared documents.

### Benchling

[Benchling](https://benchling.com/) is an online service that supports
molecular biology by managing plasmid and primer sequences and
providing tools for molecular cloning workflows. We have a shared lab
Benchling workspace where most lab members design and store their
plasmid sequences.

### GitHub

[GitHub](https://github.com/) is an online platform for software code
storage and organization, designed around the
[Git](https://git-scm.com) distributed version control system. It's
good practice to store code for data analysis in GitHub. The lab has a
GitHub "organization", [ingolia-lab](https://github.com/ingolia-lab),
allowing us to share private repositories.

## Purchasing

### Quartzy

We use [Quartzy](https://quartzy.com) to manage much of the lab's
purchasing. We enter orders into Quartzy, and Zuriah (or Nick) will
then place these orders through Berkeley's purchasing system,
BearBuy. Once they arrive, Quartzy allows us to log their location and
maintains an inventory of items we've bought.

### Barker Storeroom

The [Barker Storeroom](http://mcb.berkeley.edu/barker/storeroom/)
located in the basement of Barker Hall stocks a wide array of common
supplies and reagents. These can be purchased using the lab's
storeroom account. It's also possible to place special orders through
the storeroom using a web form. For certain vendors -- notably, New
England Biolabs -- storeroom purchases are faster and less expensive
than other ways of buying the same item. New lab members can fill out
a form to be added to the lab's storeroom account, and there's also a
separate form to get 24-hour card-key access to the storeroom.

### Oligos from IDT

We typically order custom oligonucleotides from
[IDT](https://idtdna.com/barkerstoreroom). Standard oligos (unmodified
DNA up to 60 bases long) ordered by 7pm will arrive in the Barker
Storeroom in the early afternoon of the next day. We get special
pricing negotiated through the storeroom, and oligo orders are charged
directly to our storeroom account, so you'll need to create a new
account through the [Barker Storeroom / IDT
portal](https://idtdna.com/barkerstoreroom) for these orders.

IDT also offers "gBlocks", synthetic double-stranded DNA
fragments. For fragments up to 500 bp, gBlock synthesis is fairly fast
and inexpensive, and it's often better to simply order a gBlock rather
than attempt complex multi-fragment assemblies.
