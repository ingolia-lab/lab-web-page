The organization and contents of this manual were influenced by [a
collection of lab handbooks assembled by Samuel
Mehr](https://github.com/samuelmehr/handbooks), and particularly by
[Mariam Aly](https://github.com/alylab/labmanual), [Kay
Tye](http://tyelab.mit.edu/philosophy/b), and [Talia
Lerner](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1phmA17c_hkAfLZN1yMXtFlCYlEqXEc8izEQsfoqgdTY). I
also appreciate the MCB department's statement about maintaining a
safe and respectful environment.
